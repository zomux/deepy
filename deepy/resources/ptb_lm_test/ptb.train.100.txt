 a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than N years ago researchers reported 
 the asbestos fiber <unk> is unusually <unk> once it enters the <unk> with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said 
 <unk> inc. the unit of new york-based <unk> corp. that makes kent cigarettes stopped using <unk> in its <unk> cigarette filters in N 
 although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem 
 a <unk> <unk> said this is an old story 
 we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties 
 there is no asbestos in our products now 
 neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes 
 we have no useful information on whether users are at risk said james a. <unk> of boston 's <unk> cancer institute 
 dr. <unk> led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university 
 the <unk> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of <unk> in N 
 from N to N N billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said 
 among N men who worked closely with the substance N have died more than three times the expected number 
 four of the five surviving workers have <unk> diseases including three with recently <unk> cancer 
 the total of N deaths from malignant <unk> lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected the researchers said 
 the <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> diseases said dr. <unk> 
 the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west <unk> mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said 
 the plant which is owned by <unk> & <unk> co. was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters 
 the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of asbestos <unk> found in most schools and other buildings dr. <unk> said 
 the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth <unk> fibers such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> according to <unk> t. <unk> a professor of <unk> at the university of vermont college of medicine 
 more common <unk> fibers are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body dr. <unk> explained 
 in july the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos 
 by N almost all remaining uses of <unk> asbestos will be outlawed 
 about N workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s 
 areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the <unk> was used 
 workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge <unk> poured in cotton and <unk> fibers and <unk> mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters 
 workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though <unk> fans <unk> the area 
 there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> diseases said <unk> phillips vice president of human resources for <unk> & <unk> 
 but you have to recognize that these events took place N years ago 
 it has no bearing on our work force today
